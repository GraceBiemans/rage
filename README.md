- Bidding begins with the player to the dealer's left. Each player states aloud their bid. The score keeper writes the bids on the score sheet.

- The player who wins the trick gathers the cards played and places them in a separate pile face down in front of them

- The player who won the trick starts the next trick by leading with a card from their hand.
  
- The first card of a trick may be an Action card. The second card played in a trick begun with an Action card may be any other card. The first color or Wild Rage card played will determine the lead suit of the trick. If only Action cards, not including WildRage, are played, the first card played in the round wins the trick.

Want highest numbered card of the lead suit
